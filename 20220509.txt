When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but...

If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not2019240083: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys2019240083: Aside from the fact that you said you had them2019240083: Well, you should have2019240083: Because2019240083: Because2019240083: Oh, god, this is great!

Rachel walks in and overhears the conversation2019240083: Who was that2019240083: Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye2019240083: No2019240083: Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around2019240083, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour2019240083: Done2019240083's, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking. Phoebe walks in with Steve (Crystal Duck winner Jon Lovitz)2019240083: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat2019240083) Hello, greeter girl2019240083 goes to follow them but Phoebe stops her and drags her into the kitchen2019240083: What's up2019240083: What2019240083: OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK2019240083: Let me, let me get you some wine2019240083: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything2019240083 tries to get Monica's attention to tell her Steve is stoned. She pretends to drag on a joint, and Monica thinks she's giving her the 'OK' signal. Then Rachel does it again, inhaling deeply this time. Monica waves it off as though she doesn't believe it2019240083 motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope2019240083: You don't want to work for a guy like that2019240083: Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler2019240083: No, yeah, IÕve done that2019240083: IÕve never done that2019240083: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just donÕt get along2019240083: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol2019240083: Well, isnÕt, isnÕt that gonna be weird2019240083 grins as Ross removes the girlie jacket, grabs his own, and rushes out2019240083's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese takeout, while the sitcom Family Matters is playing on the TV2019240083: (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel2019240083 slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their welcome2019240083: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing MonicaÕs note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there2019240083 and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross2019240083 and Monica do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the rhythm2019240083 is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe2019240083: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday2019240083: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn2019240083: Ooh, okay... good2019240083Õs, Phoebe is watching a Spanish version of The Waltons. At a nearby table sit Monica knitting, Rachel winding a ball of wool, and Chandler supplying them both from a skein which is spread between his hands2019240083: Oh, well, that shouldnÕt be so hard, now that youÕre dating. (Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, youÕre fired, but how Õbout a quickie before I go to work2019240083 and Chandler: Hey2019240083 has to leap over a chair to follow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there2019240083: You donÕt even have cats2019240083: WeÕll try to keep it down2019240083 has to rush ahead to avoid becoming tangled. Joey brings the shopping bag over to Phoebe, and takes out a nice cardigan2019240083: Are you seeinÕ her again tonight2019240083 resumes winding, tangling ChandlerÕs wool2019240083: This is just occurring to you2019240083: (She comforts him too) Oh, youÕre gonna be great2019240083Õs, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set2019240083: Oh, howÕd she take it2019240083: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, heÕs going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible2019240083: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No2019240083: Oh... Oh, Pheebs2019240083: Oh please, theyÕve been going out a week. They havenÕt even slept together yet, I mean, thatÕs not serious2019240083's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica sees her, so she leans out of the small side window2019240083, what are you doing? ItÕs freezing out here. Would you come back inside2019240083: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..IÕm takinÕ Õem down. Okay? Whoa!

(She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please2019240083 and Monica enter.Ê Rachel is limping and leaning on Monica for support2019240083: Ow ow ow.

Definitely, I want some of that2019240083: Why, how much is this gonna cost2019240083: Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do2019240083: (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours2019240083: (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person2019240083: Well, alright, then, forget it.

Oh good, Rach2019240083): Thank you2019240083 (as Monica): Right2019240083's, everyone but Joey is waiting for Phoebe to arrive for her surprise birthday party.Ê Rachel and Monica is telling Chandler about Rachel's incident2019240083: ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it2019240083: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes2019240083: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute2019240083 who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him2019240083: Was that the cake2019240083: I hope it's okay2019240083's, Monica is just getting off of the intercom and turns off the TV which is still in the SAP mode2019240083, the cute doctors are here2019240083: (entering from her room) Okay, coming2019240083: Hi2019240083: Oh, that's great. Look at that2019240083 discreetly coughs to warn her2019240083): ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle2019240083 (as Monica): You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT2019240083 joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway2019240083: Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine2019240083: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss2019240083: (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we..2019240083: You know what2019240083: You know what2019240083: You know what2019240083: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother2019240083 brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an open-mouthed Monica in her wake2019240083: Hello! Here we go2019240083: (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago2019240083) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar2019240083 tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair2019240083) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus2019240083: (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown2019240083: (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do2019240083) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it2019240083: (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow2019240083) I used to wet my bed2019240083: (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention2019240083) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that2019240083 lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael wins2019240083's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad2019240083) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..2019240083 who also stands up2019240083: Would you excuse me for a second2019240083) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed2019240083 almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar2019240083's, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation2019240083: (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...") ...dead2019240083 has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from again2019240083: Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here2019240083 holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern2019240083: It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god..2019240083 and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do2019240083: Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it2019240083 to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you2019240083: What2019240083: Ohhh...

As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile, while Monica struggles to smile at all2019240083: (as Monica) Hi, remember us2019240083) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um..2019240083) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh2019240083: (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check2019240083: (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either2019240083's, Chandler is neglecting the game of Scrabble, for he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters about2019240083, who is filling out an honest form at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in Ross's arms. They dash up to the admissions desk. Ross is frantic2019240083: Oh2019240083 recoil slightly2019240083, Monica, Ross and Chandler whip around for a second time, in formation2019240083 and Monica: Oh, thank you2019240083: What2019240083) Monica2019240083: (as Monica) Oh2019240083) Hi2019240083: (as Monica) Hi2019240083 sadly looks away..2019240083 look on2019240083 tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad2019240083's, everyone except Joey is there.Ê Rachel is looking out of the window and Ross is handing out some Chinese takeout.Ê There's a small SAP in the corner of the screen2019240083 points out of the window2019240083: ?ira, mira, el viejo desnudo est?haciendo el hula hoop!
